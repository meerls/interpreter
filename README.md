# The Lonely Files

In folders deep where shadows creep,
Lie files forgotten, left to weep.
Once opened bright with purpose clear,
Now drowned in dust, erased by years.

Their names half-broken, dates unknown,
Lost drafts, lost love, lost paths once shown.
A whisper hums—an echo tries,
Yet no one clicks, no one replies.

So here they wait in silent sighs,
Ghosts of work and sad goodbyes.
Will they be saved, or fade, unseen—
A memory lost in the machine?
